JalRakshak – Detection Model
JalRakshak is an autonomous surface-cleaning robot designed to address water pollution in lakes, rivers, and other water bodies. It uses advanced navigation, trash detection, and sorting systems to efficiently clean surface pollutants like plastics, algae, and debris.

Problem Statement
Water pollution is a growing environmental concern with wide-reaching impacts:

Surface pollutants such as plastic, algae, and debris threaten aquatic life and ecosystems.
Contaminated water reduces biodiversity and poses health risks to humans.
Economic sectors like tourism and fishing suffer from polluted water bodies.
